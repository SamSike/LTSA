Q.1.
In my original LTSA model, the main issue I faced was that I wanted the 
get_new_patient method to be independant of any nurses. I could make it so that
nurse.0.get_new_patient would occur, and then any nurse could assign themselves
to that patient, but it did not seem right to me. 
I tried merging all the processes by renaming all nurse[n].get_new_patient processes
to get_new_patient, but that allowed all nurses to independantly assign themselves 
to a patient, even though there was only one. 
I then tried removing the extras and renaming just nurse.0.get_new_patient to 
get_new_patient, but even though the processes were not shown as executable, 
the model was using them as tau in the Safety and Liveness checks.
It was thanks to an ED post/comment that I realised I could split one process 
into 3 names. Without it, I don't think I could finish this assignment on time,
or even figure it out.

The actual problem with the original model is that it can deadlock due to attempting
to move patients into occupied rooms. This eventually leads to running out of usable 
Orderlies, which ends up in a situation wherein multiple patients are waiting to 
enter a room, but that room can not be freed due to no orderlies being available
to move the patient to the next room.

Q.2.
I have identified the deadlock pattern and resolved it in the modified model. My 
first instinct was to use
